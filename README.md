This Python script allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by manipulating pixel values using the XOR operation with a user-provided key. It starts by loading an image and converting it to a NumPy array. During encryption, each pixel value is XORed with the key and saved as a new image. For decryption, the encrypted image is processed similarly with the same key to restore the original image, which is then saved with a new filename.
The XOR operation, short for "exclusive OR," is a binary operation that compares corresponding bits of two binary values and outputs 1 if the bits differ and 0 if they are the same. In the context of image encryption and decryption, XOR is used to modify pixel values by applying this operation with a key.
